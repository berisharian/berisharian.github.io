    <p style="padding-right: 200px;">Solving math problem's and listening to music were my priority hobbies in my childhood, but afterwards, while growing
    up I was more involved in projects and little non-profit organization's and got myself into web development.
    After finishing my second year of high-school I realised that there is more to come in programming and started
    being interested in such fields. Here come's the idea and love for programming. <br>
    Currently my hobbies are programming different languages simultaneously such like
    practicing C++ programming (object-oriented), C programming(structured), HTML/CSS, and i will be continuing next with Java
    and Javascript.</p>
